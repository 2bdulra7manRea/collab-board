# Real-Time Collaborative Application

I developed a real-time collaborative application using Socket.IO, demonstrating strong proficiency in web development. The project features modular design, effective event handling, dynamic DOM manipulation, and robust state management. The code is well-structured, readable, and maintains a smooth user experience through seamless real-time updates and personalized interactions.
